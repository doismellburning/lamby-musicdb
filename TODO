musicdb TODO
============

 * Ability to view all users

   - Send password reminders, etc.

 * Reverse @logout_required, etc. to standard Django.

 * Books.

 * Move to Django storage system.

 * Script to look at ID3 tags and extract years where we don't have one for a recording.
   - script to retag all existing music
   - script to update lengths of all broken lengths (vbrfix?)

 * Classical recordings with a single movement should show movement title (eg.
   when we only have a small part of the work and need to show that). Needs
   clearing of all existing work movement title where #movements == 1 too.
